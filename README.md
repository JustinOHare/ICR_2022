# ICR_2022
data and code to reproduce results in O'Hare et al., 2022

Source data loaded by notebook cells are located at Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration (DANDI): <link>

For each notebook, set 'dataDir' to point to the directory in which you copied the DANDISET.

As mentioned at the top of each notebook, they were created on an iPython2.7 kernel using jupyternotebook with nbextensions to enable toggling by figure. 

Code is shown exactly as used to produce each data figure in our manuscript. Feel free to explore the datasets further - most are stored as Pandas DataFrames in .pkl files and are thoroughly annotated, e.g. with animal ID, dendrite type, dendrite order, dendrite path distance to soma, dendrite parent soma, ROI genotype, etc. Enjoy!
